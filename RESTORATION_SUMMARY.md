# Indoor Navigation App - Restoration Progress

## ‚úÖ Successfully Restored Features

### 1. **Core Map Display**

- **FloorPlanView**: Custom view that displays interactive floor plans
- **Floor Plan Loading**: Loads the ground floor plan from drawable resources
- **Pan & Zoom**: Touch gestures for map navigation
- **Building Dimensions**: Proper scaling with real-world coordinates (80m x 60m)

### 2. **User Positioning System**

- **PositioningViewModel**: Manages user location and positioning state
- **Demo Beacon Simulation**: 3 virtual beacons with realistic RSSI simulation
- **Trilateration**: Mathematical position calculation using beacon distances
- **Moving Position**: Simulated user movement using trigonometric patterns
- **Position Accuracy**: Real-time accuracy estimation displayed in UI

### 3. **Visual Elements**

- **User Location Marker**: Shows current position with custom icon
- **Beacon Markers**: Visual markers for demo beacons on the map
- **Breadcrumb Trail**: Shows movement history with fading points
- **Direction Indicator**: Arrow showing movement direction

### 4. **Navigation & Routing**

- **PathfindingEngine**: A* algorithm for optimal route calculation
- **Navigation Graph**: Predefined nodes (Entrance, Central Hall, Laman Najib)
- **Route Visualization**: Visual path display with smooth curves
- **Touch Navigation**: Tap map to set destination and calculate route
- **Navigation Metrics**: Distance and estimated time display

### 5. **Search & POI System**

- **Search Dialog**: Quick access to predefined destinations
- **POI Selection**: Choose from 6 predefined locations
- **Auto-routing**: Automatic route calculation to selected destinations

### 6. **UI Components**

- **Status Cards**: Real-time location and accuracy information
- **Navigation Controls**: Menu, settings, and location centering
- **Interactive Elements**: Touch-responsive map and controls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for all major functions

## üéÆ How to Use the Restored App

### Basic Operation:

1. **Start Demo Positioning**: Long-press the location FAB to start/stop demo positioning
2. **Set Position**: Tap anywhere on the map to set your position (if no current position)
3. **Navigate**: Tap on the map to set a destination and see the route
4. **Search**: Tap the search bar to select from predefined destinations
5. **Center View**: Tap the location FAB to center on your current position

### Demo Features:

- **Automatic Movement**: User position moves in a pattern when demo positioning is active
- **Real-time Updates**: Position updates every 2 seconds with varying accuracy
- **Visual Feedback**: See your movement trail and current direction
- **Route Recalculation**: Routes update dynamically as you move

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture:

- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModel manages state, Fragment handles UI
- **Reactive UI**: StateFlow/Flow for real-time updates
- **Custom Views**: FloorPlanView with advanced graphics capabilities
- **Mathematical Positioning**: RSSI-to-distance conversion and trilateration

### Performance:

- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized drawing with proper matrix transformations
- **Memory Management**: Proper lifecycle handling and resource cleanup
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive exception handling throughout

## üöÄ Next Steps for Full Restoration

The foundation is now solid and crash-free. To continue restoration:

1. **Real BLE Integration**: Replace demo beacons with actual BLE scanning
2. **WiFi Positioning**: Add WiFi access point-based positioning
3. **Sensor Fusion**: Combine BLE, WiFi, and device sensors
4. **Advanced UI**: Restore complex ViewModels and custom views
5. **Database Integration**: Add beacon management and floor plan storage
6. **Real POI System**: Dynamic POI loading and management

The app now provides a stable, functional indoor navigation experience with simulated positioning
that can be gradually enhanced with real sensors and more complex features.
