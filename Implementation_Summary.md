# UI Integration Summary

I've implemented several components to integrate the sidebar UI and main page according to the
screenshots:

## Files Created

1. **Custom Drawer Layout**: `custom_drawer_layout.xml`
    - Purple background with menu options
    - About Us, Theme toggle, Language selector, Debug mode, and Logout options
    - Bottom indicator

2. **New Map Layout**: `fragment_map_new.xml`
    - Floor plan view at the top
    - Search bar in the middle
    - "RECENT" section with history of locations

3. **Recent Location Item**: `item_recent_location.xml`
    - Layout for individual recent location entries
    - History icon and location name

4. **Recent Locations Adapter**: `RecentLocationsAdapter.kt`
    - Adapter to manage the list of recent locations
    - Click handling for navigation

5. **Recent Locations ViewModel**: `RecentLocationsViewModel.kt`
    - Manages the list of recent locations
    - Sample data for demonstration

## Existing Files Modified:

1. **Main Activity Layout**: Updated `activity_main.xml`
    - Replaced NavigationView with custom drawer layout
    - Updated toolbar with "CS1" title

## Next Steps:

To fully implement the UI, the following additional steps would be needed:

1. Update the `MainActivity.kt` to:
    - Handle events from the custom drawer (theme toggle, language selector, etc.)
    - Use the new map fragment as the main content

2. Create a navigation graph that includes the new map fragment

3. Connect all components to complete the implementation

The current implementation provides a foundation for the UI shown in the screenshots, with key
components ready to be connected.
